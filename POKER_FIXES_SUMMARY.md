# Poker Fixes Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

The user reported several critical issues with the poker game:

1. **Not evaluating hand when all players fold except one**
2. **Not allowing users to check**
3. **Not allowing many actions**
4. **Raise button should allow users to input/choose amount**

## âœ… Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Hand Evaluation When All Players Fold**

**Problem**: When all players except one folded, the game didn't automatically award the pot to the remaining player.

**Solution**: Added logic in `playerAction` method to detect when only one player remains active:

```javascript
// Check if all players except one have folded
const activePlayers = room.players.filter((p) => !p.folded);
if (activePlayers.length === 1) {
  console.log(`All players except one folded, ending hand`);
  // Award pot to the last remaining player
  const winner = activePlayers[0];
  winner.chips += room.pot;
  room.pot = 0;

  // Reset game state for next hand
  await this.resetGameState(room);

  // Notify players
  this.ws.broadcastToRoom(roomId, {
    type: "hand_ended",
    winner: winner,
    reason: "all_folded",
    room: room,
  });

  return room;
}
```

**Result**: âœ… When all players fold except one, the remaining player automatically wins the pot and the game resets for the next hand.

### 2. **Fixed Check Functionality**

**Problem**: Players couldn't check when they should be able to.

**Solution**: Improved the check validation logic in both backend and frontend:

**Backend** (`executePlayerAction`):

```javascript
case "check":
  if (room.currentBet > player.bet) {
    throw new Error("Cannot check when there's a bet to call");
  }
  console.log(`Player ${player.id} checked`);
  break;
```

**Frontend** (`getValidActions`):

```javascript
// Check if can check (no current bet or player has matched the bet)
if (currentBet === 0 || currentBet === playerBet) {
  actions.push({ type: "check", label: "Check" });
}
```

**Result**: âœ… Players can now check when there's no current bet or when they've already matched the current bet.

### 3. **Fixed Raise Functionality with Amount Input**

**Problem**: Raise button didn't allow users to input or choose the amount to raise.

**Solution**: Implemented a raise modal in the frontend:

**Frontend Changes**:

1. **Added raise modal state**:

```javascript
const [showRaiseModal, setShowRaiseModal] = useState(false);
const [raiseAmount, setRaiseAmount] = useState("");
```

2. **Added raise handler**:

```javascript
const handleRaise = () => {
  if (!canAct) return;

  const amount = parseInt(raiseAmount);
  if (isNaN(amount) || amount <= 0) {
    Alert.alert("Error", "Please enter a valid amount");
    return;
  }

  handleAction("raise", amount);
  setShowRaiseModal(false);
  setRaiseAmount("");
};
```

3. **Updated action validation**:

```javascript
// Can raise if there's a current bet or no bet
const minRaise = currentBet > 0 ? currentBet + room.minBet : room.minBet;
if (playerChips >= minRaise) {
  actions.push({
    type: "raise",
    label: "Raise...",
    amount: minRaise,
    requiresInput: true,
  });
}
```

4. **Added raise modal component**:

```javascript
const renderRaiseModal = () => (
  <Modal
    visible={showRaiseModal}
    transparent={true}
    animationType="slide"
    onRequestClose={() => setShowRaiseModal(false)}
  >
    <View style={styles.modalOverlay}>
      <View style={styles.modalContent}>
        <Text style={styles.modalTitle}>Enter Raise Amount</Text>
        <TextInput
          style={styles.raiseInput}
          value={raiseAmount}
          onChangeText={setRaiseAmount}
          placeholder="Amount"
          keyboardType="numeric"
          placeholderTextColor="#666"
        />
        <View style={styles.modalButtons}>
          <TouchableOpacity
            style={[styles.modalButton, styles.cancelButton]}
            onPress={() => setShowRaiseModal(false)}
          >
            <Text style={styles.modalButtonText}>Cancel</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
          <TouchableOpacity
            style={[styles.modalButton, styles.confirmButton]}
            onPress={handleRaise}
          >
            <Text style={styles.modalButtonText}>Raise</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
      </View>
    </View>
  </Modal>
);
```

**Result**: âœ… Players can now click "Raise..." button, which opens a modal where they can enter their desired raise amount.

### 4. **Improved Action Validation**

**Problem**: The game was too restrictive and not allowing many valid actions.

**Solution**: Enhanced the action validation logic to be more permissive and accurate:

**Frontend Improvements**:

```javascript
const getValidActions = () => {
  if (!canAct || !currentPlayer || !room) return [];

  const actions = [];
  const currentBet = room.currentBet;
  const playerBet = currentPlayer.bet;
  const playerChips = currentPlayer.chips;

  // Always can fold
  actions.push({ type: "fold", label: "Fold" });

  // Check if can check (no current bet or player has matched the bet)
  if (currentBet === 0 || currentBet === playerBet) {
    actions.push({ type: "check", label: "Check" });
  }

  // Can call if there's a bet to call
  if (currentBet > playerBet) {
    const callAmount = Math.min(currentBet - playerBet, playerChips);
    if (callAmount > 0) {
      actions.push({
        type: "call",
        label: `Call $${callAmount}`,
        amount: callAmount,
      });
    }
  }

  // Can bet if no current bet
  if (currentBet === 0 && playerChips >= room.minBet) {
    actions.push({
      type: "bet",
      label: `Bet $${room.minBet}`,
      amount: room.minBet,
    });
  }

  // Can raise if there's a current bet or no bet
  const minRaise = currentBet > 0 ? currentBet + room.minBet : room.minBet;
  if (playerChips >= minRaise) {
    actions.push({
      type: "raise",
      label: "Raise...",
      amount: minRaise,
      requiresInput: true,
    });
  }

  // Can always go all-in
  if (playerChips > 0) {
    actions.push({
      type: "all-in",
      label: `All-In $${playerChips}`,
      amount: playerChips,
    });
  }

  return actions;
};
```

**Result**: âœ… Players now have access to all valid actions based on the current game state.
